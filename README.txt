This project serves as both an intellectual exercise to understand the very low level details of deep learning as well as a sandbox to test crazy ideas that might be harder to test in more mainstream toolkits!

There are some modules and experiments missing. I will be committing these as I clean them up!

Missing modules include:
Image -- Basic image backpropagating operations (e.g. Convolution)
Trees -- My implementation of Hinge Trees/Ferns/Forests and a backpropagating version of Feature Selection and Annealing.
Exotic -- A collection of odd nodes that implement weird loss functions for weird theoretical learning frameworks.

I will also eventually document the SAD file syntax for defining graphs and subgraphs as well as cmake/source code features to extend functionality.

Though, this repository and its documentation will ultimately serve me more than anyone unfortunate enough to stumble here!

Stay tuned!
