This project serves as both an intellectual exercise to understand the very low level details of deep learning as well as a sandbox to test crazy ideas that might be harder to test in more mainstream toolkits!

I will eventually document the SAD file syntax for defining graphs and subgraphs as well as cmake/source code features to extend functionality.

Though, this repository and its documentation will ultimately serve me more than anyone unfortunate enough to stumble here!

Stay tuned!
